<p class="ui header product-top-header" title="Project 3 Introduction - the SeaPort Project series Solution">For this set of projects for the course, we wish to simulate some of the aspects of a number of Sea Ports.Here are the classes and their instance variables we wish to define: SeaPortProgram extends JFrameo variables used by the GUI interfaceo world: World Thing implement Comparable &lt;Thingo index: into name: Stringo parent: int World extends Thingo ports: ArrayList &lt;SeaPorto time: PortTime SeaPort extends Thingo docks: ArrayList &lt;Docko que: ArrayList &lt;Ship // the list of ships waiting to docko ships: ArrayList &lt;Ship // a list of all the ships at this porto persons: ArrayList &lt;Person // people with skills at this port Dock extends Thingo ship: Ship Ship extends Thingo arrivalTime, dockTime: PortTimeo draft, length, weight, width: doubleo jobs: ArrayList &lt;Job PassengerShip extends Shipo numberOfOccupiedRooms: into numberOfPassengers: into numberOfRooms: int CargoShip extends Shipo cargoValue: doubleo cargoVolume: doubleo cargoWeight: double Person extends Thingo skill: String Job extends Thing – optional till Projects 3 and 4o duration: doubleo requirements: ArrayList &lt;String// should be some of the skills of the persons PortTimeo time: intEventually, in Projects 3 and 4, you will be asked to show the progress of the jobs using JProgressBar’s.

Here’s a very quick overview of all projects:1. Read a data file, create the internal data structure, create a GUI to display the structure, and let the user search the structure.2. Sort the structure, use hash maps to create the structure more efficiently.3. Create a thread for each job, cannot run until a ship has a dock, create a GUI to show the progress of each job.4. Simulate competing for resources (persons with particular skills) for each job

<strong>Project 3 General Objectives</strong>

Project 3 – More JDK classes – GUI’s and threads Explore other GUI classes, such as JTree, JTable, and JProgressBar. Create and run threadso Competing for one resource.Documentation Requirements:You should start working on a documentation file before you do anything else with these projects, and fill in items as you go along. Leaving the documentation until the project is finished is not a good idea for any number of reasons.The documentation should include the following (graded) elements: Cover page (including name, date, project, your class information) Designo including a UML class diagramo classes, variables and methods: what they mean and why they are thereo tied to the requirements of the project User’s Guideo how would a user start and run your projecto any special featureso effective screen shots are welcome, but don’t overdo this Test Plano do this BEFORE you code anythingo what do you EXPECT the project to doo justification for various data files, for example Lessons Learnedo express yourself hereo a way to keep good memories of successes after hard work

<strong>Project 3 Specific Goals:</strong>Implement threads and a GUI interface using advanced Java Swing classes.1. Required data structure specified in Project 1:1. World has SeaPort’s2. SeaPort has Dock’s, Ship’s, and Person’s3. Dock has a Ship4. Ship has Job’s5. PassengerShip6. CargoShip7. Person has a skill8. Job requires skills- NEW CLASS for this project!9. PortTime2. Extend Project 2 to use the Swing class JTree effectively to display the contents of the data file.o (Optional) Implement a JTable to also show the contents of the data file. There are lots of options here for extending your program.3. Threads:o Implement a thread for each job representing a task that ship requires.o Use the synchronize directive to avoid race conditions and insure that a dock isperforming the jobs for only one ship at a time. the jobs of a ship in the queue should not be progressing when all the jobs for a ship are done, the ship should leave the dock, allowing aship from the que to dock once the ship is docked, the ships jobs should all progress in Project 4, the jobs will also require persons with appropriate skills.o The thread for each job should be started as the job is read in from the data file.o Use delays to simulate the progress of each job.o Use a JProgressBar for each job to display the progress of that job.o Use JButton’s on the Job panel to allow the job to be suspended or cancelled.4. As before, the GUI elements should be distinct (as appropriate) from the other classes in the program.5. See the code at the end of this posting for some suggestions.Suggestions for Project 3 Job class. Here is a sample of code for a Job class in another context, the Sorcerer’s Cave project. The code for this class will need some modifications, but this should give you an idea of the issues involved.In fact, you should find much of this code redundant.Also, some of the code at the following sites might give you some ideas about how to proceed with this project: Project 3 Example – Sorcerer’s Cave, note that even this one isn’t complete run method – detailed analysis of the run method in the Job class in the Cave project// j:&lt;index:&lt;name:&lt;creature index:&lt;time[:&lt;required artifact type:&lt;number]*class Job extends CaveElement implements Runnable {static Random rn = new Random ();

Your project is due by midnight, EST, on the day of the date posted in the class schedule. We do not recommend staying up all night working on your project – it is so very easy to really mess up a project at the last minute by working when one was overly tired.Your instructor’s policy on late projects applies to this project.Submitted projects that show evidence of plagiarism will be handled in accordance with UMUC Policy 150.25 — Academic Dishonesty and Plagiarism.Format:The documentation describing and reflecting on your design and approach should be written using Microsoft Word or PDF, and should be of reasonable length. The font size should be 12 point. The page margins should be one inch. The paragraphs should be double spaced. All figures, tables, equations, andreferences should be properly labeled and formatted using APA style.Coding Hints: Code format: (See Google Java Style guide for specifics(<a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)</a>)o header comment block, including the following information in each source code file:o file nameo dateo authoro purposeo appropriate comments within the codeo appropriate variable and function nameso correct indentation Errors:o code submitted should have no compilation or run-time errors Warnings:o Your program should have no warningso Use the following compiler flag to show all warnings:javac -Xlint *.javao More about setting up IDE’s to show warningso Generics – your code should use generic declarations appropriately, and to eliminate allwarnings Elegance:o just the right amount of codeo effective use of existing classes in the JDKo effective use of the class hierarchy, including features related to polymorphism. GUI notes:o GUI should resize nicelyo DO NOT use the GUI editor/generators in an IDE (integrated development environment,such as Netbeans and Eclipse)o Do use JPanel, JFrame, JTextArea, JTextField, JButton, JLabel, JScrollPane panels on panels gives even more control of the display during resizing JTable and/or JTree for Projects 2, 3 and 48 Font using the following gives a nicer display for this program, setting for theJTextArea jta:jta.setFont (new java.awt.Font (“Monospaced”, 0, 12));o GridLayout and BorderLayout – FlowLayout rarely resizes nicely GridBagLayout for extreme control over the displays you may wish to explore other layout managerso ActionListener, ActionEvent – responding to JButton events Starting with JDK 8, lambda expression make defining listeners MUCH simpler.See the example below, with jbr (read), jbd (display) and jbs (search) threedifferent JButtons.jcb is a JComboBox &lt;String and jtf is a JTextField.jbr.addActionListener (e – readFile());jbd.addActionListener (e – displayCave ());jbs.addActionListener (e – search ((String)(jcb.getSelectedItem()),jtf.getText()));o JFileChooser – select data file at run timeo JSplitPane – optional, but gives user even more control over display panels
